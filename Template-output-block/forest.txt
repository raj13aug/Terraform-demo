Forests are essential for animals as well as for humans. 
Humans are dependent on forests for various reasons, and animals are dependent on forests for their habitat and survival.
We get various types of ${common[0]}  ${common[1]} , ${common[2]} , ${common[3]} , ${common[4]} , etc., from forests. Wild animals like ${animals[0]} ${animals[1]} , ${animals[1]} , ${animals[2]} , ${animals[3]} , ${animals[4]} , ${animals[5]} , etc., live in forests, and their whole survival is dependent on forests and forest products. 
Forests bring us rain and maintain the balance in the environment. The ecosystem will be depleted with the depletion of forests. 
Therefore, it is essential to stop cutting down trees and save our forests.
